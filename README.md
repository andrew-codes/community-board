Running for Production
======================

```bash
npm install
NODE_ENV=production npm start # http://localhost:8091
```

Running for Development
=======================

When running in development, the server and client components will be hot-reloadable. Any changes made to the application should not require a restart of the server and should push to the client browser.

```bash
npm install
npm start # http://localhost:8091
```
